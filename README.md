# stip (SpatioTemporal Image Partitioner)
## OVERVIEW
A distributed spatiotemporal image management framework designed specifically for training neural networks.

## TODO
- abstract task functionality - lots of code copies
- **add timestamps - queries, return data, etc**
- **integrate query indexing data structures - use sqlite on backend?**
- image replication? - one replica on geohash of length (x - 1)
- improve node logging
- **set read all permissions on created directories and files**
- open listening sockets on 0.0.0.0
#### COMMANDS 
- __data load - support MODIS data__
- **cloud coverage - computation on images**
- task stop?
