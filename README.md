# STIP (SpatioTemporal Image Partitioner)
## OVERVIEW
A distributed spatiotemporal image management framework designed specifically for training neural networks.

## TODO
- abstract task functionality - lots of code copies
- image replication? - one replica on geohash of length (x - 1)
- improve node logging
- use GeoTiff metadata attributes instead of .meta files
    - maybe instead use a secondary index?
#### COMMANDS 
- 'cloud coverage' - computation on images
- 'data merge'?
- 'data search' - add coverage (pixel and cloud) filters
- 'task stop'?
