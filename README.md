# STIP (SpatioTemporal Image Partitioner)
## OVERVIEW
A distributed spatiotemporal image management framework designed specifically for training neural networks.

## TODO
- abstract task functionality - lots of code copies
- image replication? - one replica on geohash of length (x - 1)
- improve node logging
#### COMMANDS 
- __'cloud coverage' - computation on images__
- __data fill - ensure resulting image has more pixel coverage than parts__
- **'data list / search' - add coverage (pixel and cloud) filters**
- 'data merge'?
- 'task stop'?
