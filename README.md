# STIP (SpatioTemporal Image Partitioner)
## OVERVIEW
A distributed spatiotemporal image management framework designed specifically for training neural networks.

## TODO
- abstract task functionality - lots of code copies
- image replication? - one replica on geohash of length (x - 1)
- improve node logging
#### COMMANDS 
- __cloud coverage - computation on images__
- data merge?
- task stop?
